# Learning Targets

I can:

* Determine the number of bits per symbol needed for a representation system based on the total number of symbols it is necessary to represent.
* Use the decimal number system when designing ways to represent other information in binary.
* Explain how bits are grouped to represent abstractions like numbers and text.
